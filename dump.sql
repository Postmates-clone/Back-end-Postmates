You won’t be able to get it out of your head. Or your mouth.	9.19	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/87790eab-a8f6-45d6-aa61-bf46b82d41b0/original.jpg?v=63731400154
19474	Southwest Salad	Pack your bags because you’re going southwest, my friend. To a salad made with a blend of iceberg and romaine lettuce. And your choice of Flame grilled chicken or crispy all-white meat chicken—along with shredded cheddar cheese, roasted corn, grape tomatoes, black beans, spicy corn sticks and creamy southwest dressing. Actually, forget the bags. Pack a fork.	9.19	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/5a1bcc2d-daaf-43e9-a52d-09ab1d173169/original.jpg?v=63731400165
19475	French Fries	Most French fries in the world don’t deserve their own description, but Jack’s do. Because these lightly salted, real potatoes are fried to crispy perfection and served hot and salty. They’re just that tasty.	3.75	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/df8c3bcd-808b-4a13-805d-969efc1f29d9/original.jpg?v=63731400033
19476	Panko Onion Rings	True love is not an engagement ring. It’s an onion ring—panko breaded and fried to jaw-dropping perfection. But using an onion ring as an engagement ring? The judge will allow it. Just kidding. There’s not a judge for this type thing. Do whatever your stomach desires.	5.19	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/302ffa2e-6895-4883-a336-ac083f4fe86e/original.jpg?v=63731400046
19477	Stuffed Jalapeños	Where most see jalapeños, Jack sees opportunity. To bread ‘em and fill ‘em with melted cheeses. Yes, plural. And, if things get too hot, there’s tasty buttermilk ranch dipping sauce to cool down. Mmhmm. Jack’s got your back. And your stomach.	4.95	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/1fdb4e20-afbf-401c-9c0b-1fdb6fbc33c6/original.jpg?v=63731400059
19478	Egg Roll	It’s what’s on the inside that counts. That goes for you, sure. But it definitely goes for these crispy egg rolls—filled with diced pork, cabbage, celery, carrots, onions, and spices. But don’t forget the outside, where there’s sweet and sour dipping sauce. You can’t go wrong, really.	3.49	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/10e2c9b9-2749-4634-afc9-488f0e2a2395/original.jpg?v=63731400075
19479	Seasoned Curly Fries	These Curly Fries are seasoned, alright. Seasoned veterans. They’ve been around the block—gathering deliciousness and flavor from all over. So, they know how to make your mouth water. And your tastebuds do their secret handshake.	4.25	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/fe78f686-1e47-4d76-89a4-e792de413052/original.jpg?v=63731400084
19480	Bacon Cheddar Potato Wedges	It doesn’t get any better than golden brown potato wedges. Well, unless you add melted cheddar cheese sauce, shredded cheddar cheese, and diced bacon bits. Which is exactly what we did. Microphone, consider yourself dropped.	5.19	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/c28bbc82-2348-4ef3-a87e-6c40fc59bfe0/original.jpg?v=63731400095
19482	Two Tacos	Sure, one is nice. But do you know what’s better? Two. Two crunchy tacos with American cheese, shredded lettuce, and taco sauce. Because two will always be greater than one. Who knew math could be so mouth-watering? Oh, right. We did.	1.99	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/75f8f324-d480-403e-8add-d1116dac40d1/original.jpg?v=63731399945

19484	Chicken Nuggets	One man’s all-white meat chicken nuggets are another man’s…well, nothing. Because that first man ate all of that crispy chicken amazingness. Next time, get your own, second man.	2.95	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/1e6251c0-9ad3-4cfb-b094-51a5cae58e04/original.jpg?v=63731399969
19485	Chicken Sandwich	Chicken Sandwich, meet mouth. Mouth, meet Chicken Sandwich—made with a breaded chicken patty, real mayonnaise, and lettuce, all on a regular bun. You two will get along just fine. Just fine, indeed.	2.75	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/36856d35-ec9d-46ab-9a87-699c75b96de7/original.jpg?v=63728357562
19486	Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger	You ever call something “junior,” ironically? Well, if you haven’t, you’re about to. Because this Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger is a 100% beef patty topped with hickory smoked bacon, American cheese, real mayonnaise and ketchup. And now you have a “junior” appetite. See what we did there?	3.49	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/ce865579-8b42-4b00-a0a8-a3affbc21a67/original.jpg?v=63731399984
19487	Jr. Jumbo Jack	Anywhere else this Jr. Jack would be senior. Because there is nothing junior about this honest-to-goodness beef patty topped with tomato, pickle, lettuce, and chopped onions—with the just-right amount of ketchup and real mayonnaise. But here? It’s got some growing up to do.	2.99	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/0c0a6dd6-a8d0-489b-bfe2-b0233a2e7621/original.jpg?v=63731399993
19488	Jumbo Jack	When you pick up the Jumbo Jack—made with a 100% beef patty topped with hand leafed lettuce, tomato, pickles, chopped onions, and real mayonnaise on a buttery bakery bun—your arms will tremble. And your mouth will open. It’s the delicious type of workout.	4.45	https://items-static.postmates.com/uploads/media/2a12a3ca-ac3f-418d-9f4e-07a24d3f9043/original.jpg?v=63731400017
